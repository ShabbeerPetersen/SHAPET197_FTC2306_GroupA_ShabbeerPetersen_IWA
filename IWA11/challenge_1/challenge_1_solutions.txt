It uses the document.querySelector() method to select the 
elements with specific data attributes like 
data-key="order1". This allows you to target each order 
section specifically.

Inside each order section, it further uses querySelector() 
to select the specific elements like 
.biscuits .count, .donuts .count, etc., 
where the "Loading..." placeholders are located.

It retrieves the values from the corresponding data 
attributes using the getAttribute() method and updates the 
text content of these elements with the actual values.

For the status, it checks the value of the data-delivered 
attribute and displays either "Delivered" or "Pending" 
accordingly.

The script repeats this process for each order section, 
replacing the "Loading..." placeholders with the 
actual values from the data attributes.
