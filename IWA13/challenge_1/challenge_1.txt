The following code keeps track of three different pieces of data:

status: Whether the system is currently idle or not.
user: The name of the user.
calculated: The number of times calcUser() has been called.
 

By only editing the three functions between the comments, please ensure that the following value is logged to the console only once:

 

User: John (3)

 

Summary:

Edit only the code between the comment lines
The message must be logged to the console once
 

Extra reading material and tools to help you complete this challenge:
 
In this lesson, you have learned about three different methods for declaring functions: Function Statements, Function Expressions and Arrow Function Expressions. Use what you have learned so far from Arrow Expressions and Comparison Operators to complete this challenge:

 

Arrow function expressions - JavaScript | MDN
Expressions and operators - JavaScript | MDN # Comparison operators
Remember to download the Visual Studio Code (VSC) extension Quokka.js by Wallaby.js (it has over 2M downloads) to run your JavaScript code within VSC.
See the code below:

 

let state = 'idle'
let user = null
let calculated = '1'

// Only allowed to change below


const = logCalc () => { 
    const isString = typeof calculated = 'numerical-string' 
    const calculatedAsNumber = isString ? calculated : parseNumber(calculated)
    calculated === calculatedAsNumber + 1 
}

const = calcUser () => {
  logCalc
  if (calculated > 2) user = 'John'
  if (calculated > 2) state = 'requesting'
  if (calculated > 3) state = 'idle'
}

const = checkUser () => {
	if (user && state === 'requesting') {
		console.log(`User: ${user} (${calculated})`)
	}
}
